***The Cart***
Each User will has a cart object as a part of its document. unauthenticated users will not be able to use the cart, and they will be directed to the login/register page.

The cart will hold the currency chosen by the user, the total amount of items in the cart for quick access, and an array which will contain the items themselves.

Each item in the items array will be an object that will contain the following:
Name, price, [color, price both are editable], and the total quantity (how many units of the items exists in the cart)

The cart will have the following actions:

A- add item: add an item to the cart. there is two possible course of action here:
    1- the item isn't in the Cart
    2- the item is in the cart

    either ways, the items array will be searched for the item to be added. if it exists, then only the quantity property in it will be increased
    if it does not, then a new item entry will be created

(B- increase quantity of an item
C- decrease quantity of an item) both of these can be managed by one function -change quantity-
D- delete an item from the cart
E- edit item details: color and size
F- delete an item directly
G- empty cart

H- Change the currency of the cart


the item entry will show the available colors and sizes and highlights the selected one

Once the user proceeds to the checkout, an order with the items in the cart will be created


To do now:
    make the cart endpoints then carry on with the charge system

    Done:
        1- items can be added to the cart. if the item already exist, the quantity will be increased, and Update the cart total item count
        2- items can be edited after selected (this includes changing quantity, deleting the item, and changing color and size)

        to add or edit an item, the data must be sent in an object under a prop called "product_info
        adding requires: model_id, type, and qty[optional]
        updating requires: model_id, qty-colors-sizes[optional]

        3- Individual items can be deleted based on their model_id
        4- the items in the cart can all be deleted at once
        5- currency can be changed


        there is something to consider:
        what if a user wants to buy the same item twice. each in different size or color. the code should be ready for this
